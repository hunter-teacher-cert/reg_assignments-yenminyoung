The article opens with a brief letter from the reader, describing their fear and anxiety around death.
They downloaded an app called WeCroak, to remind them 5 times a day about their mortality.
Unfortunately, instead of helping them prioritize their life and accept mortality, it just made them more anxious.

The author of the article offers an adviced-style letter, explaining that WeCroak's model was based on a Bhutanese proverb, claiming that happiness can be achieved by contemplating death five times a day.
It works well in Bhutan, a Buddhist culture, because they already integrate the acceptance of suffering and death in many more aspects of their life.
However, it doesn't work so well in Western countries because we tend to 1.) seek escape from all suffering and 2.) rely heavily on information (but death is the only thing we cannot predict).

I chose this article and find it very interesting because it is another application of technology to "improve" our lives.
WeCroak falls under "mental wellness" because it is meant to help guide someone's mentality and worldview.  I never thought of this darker side of mental health app before.
However, what's interesting is that it ultimately shows the limitation of technology as well.  We can predict the weather, or even how busy a restaurant is going to be.
But death is the only thing that we cannot predict, where algorithms cannot be exact.
