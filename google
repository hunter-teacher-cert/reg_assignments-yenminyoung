* Create or use an existing programming task in a programming language of a class you are teaching (or would like to teach).
  - The task should involve multiple steps, ~5.
* Run a few internet searches that a student might run when presented with your task.
* In a markdown file:
  - Describe the task
  - For each search you ran provide three links from the results
    - Provide a critique on the result. Things to consider:
      - Was it useful?
      - Was it too simple/complex?
      - Was it unecessarily compicated?
      - Did it include copypastable code?
      - Did you learn from it/could a student learn from it?
