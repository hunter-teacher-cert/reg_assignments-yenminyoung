  ## Equity Grading
  
  I really appreciate listening to this podcast because I find myself agreeing with a lot of what this guy says (to a degree).  Yes - we HARDLY talk about grading when preparing teachers.  The first time someone asked me to meaningfully think about what the numbers mean was in my first year of teaching.  Like so many aspects of teaching, I only knew what was done to me.
  
  I liked how he called out the points-based language of grading, and his alternate sounds a lot like Mastery-Based Grading.  I'm a huge fan of MBG because 1.) it saves me a lot of time grading and 2.) it's a huge shift in mentality for students and how they approach learning.  They think about evaluating themselves and seeing, "oh do I really understand this?".  I only applied MBG to my Physics class, so now I'm looking forward to applying it to my CS classes.  I mean - I still carry a lot of the same philosophy.  But I think with creating new rubrics, I needed tangible, concrete measurables for me to grade based on.  So my rubrics are based a lot on checking off boxes and points, rather than holistic mastery.  I think I need to go through the rubrics and re-evaluate the language I use.
  
  What I don't 100% agree with is his bit about behavior and knowledge.  It's true that you could have poor content knowledge but be really good about student behavior and turning in work, and therefore get a B.  And you could really understand the material but not turn in work and still get a B.  I think both reasons for getting a B is valid.  They both excelled in some way, but not the other, so they don't earn a full A, but they shouldn't get a failing grade either.
  He says that if you take away the points, they'll still do the work, and I think that is really idealistic and applies to cases where other things are going super great - the students are personally invested in the material and are intrinsically motivated.  But realistically, they won't do the "extra" practice work if they know they won't get credit for it.  I think the teacher would have to really coach in to this concept that doing the practice work is helpful for them and will ultimately get them a higher grade.  Otherwise, they won't make the connections themselves.
  I also think it is good to reward strong work ethic since that's what helps people succeed in the long run.
